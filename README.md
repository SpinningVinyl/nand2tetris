### Asm2Hack

This is my implementation of Hack assembler which translates programs written in Hack symbolic assembly language into machine code.

Usage:

```
python asm2hack.py path/to/source/file.asm
```

### VM Translator

Translates programs written in the VM language into Hack symbolic assembly. This is a full implementation that supports all Hack VM commands: push/pop, arithmetic instructions, program flow and function calls/returns. Passes all tests, including FibonacciElements.

Usage:

```
python vmtranslator.py path/to/source/directory
python vmtranslator.py path/to/source/file.vm
```
